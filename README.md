How to install? Simple **af!**

> **Download the extension from "Releases Tab":**

> - With your **"com.saademotion.youtubeScreenshot.zip"** put anywhere you want.
> - Extract the file to anywhere you want again... (i just created the extension, now do some hard choices too).
> - Open chrome extensions tab `chrome://extensions`, (ok i will put a link for you lazy boy...) just click here: [Chrome Extensions](http://memeblender.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/troll-face-meme-super-lazy.jpg).
> - Turn on "Developer Mode" by checking this guy here:

> - Click on **"Load unpacked Extension"** then select the folder you extracted. If you forgot the path, you can try a suicide.
> - That's It!

#### <i class="icon-camera"></i> Usage:

Open a noice video on youtube, then select the highest quality possible (for better quality ~dãh);

![Noice Video](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-unzyvDFAV2I/WFJUzOKD70I/AAAAAAAALYU/KTcriKR86UIUNe4-ZuMcHo94XXOvfgUgACLcB/s0/Screenshot+at+dez+15+06-30-13.png "Noice video")

Then magically a button like this one: <i class="icon-camera"></i> will appear right after "Fullscreen" icon. (If you are blind, here are some Braille: ⠠⠊⠋ ⠽⠕⠥ ⠉⠁⠝ ⠎⠑⠑ ⠞⠓⠊⠎⠂ ⠽⠕⠥ ⠁⠗⠑ ⠝⠕⠞ ⠃⠇⠊⠝⠙⠲ ⠠⠛⠕ ⠙⠕ ⠎⠕⠍⠑ ⠎⠞⠥⠋⠋ )

- Just click on it, then Right Click > [Save Image Ass]

- Some magic will occur and your image will download.

#### <i class="icon-smile"></i> Thats it! Thanks!
